# cda1tenth_bringup

This package contains the launch and configuration files needed to bring up a physical or simulated CDA1tenth vehicle. Some functionality may depend on the companion packages from [navigation2_extensions](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/navigation2_extensions) which provides route server and CDA additions to the CDA1tenth system.

## Prerequisites

The following configuration steps must be completed before a CDA1tenth vehicle or simulation will be ready for bringup.

1. Download the `nav2_route_server` branch and build it from source, which can be found [here](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/navigation2/tree/nav2_route_server).

2. Install the following udev rules to the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` directory if using a physical vehicle:
    * `99-joypad-f710.rules`
    * `99-vesc6.rules`
    * `rplidar.rules`

    > [NOTE]
    > See [1. udev Rules Setup](https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/foxy_test/getting_started/firmware/drive_workspace.html#udev-rules-setup) in the F1Tenth build documentation for details.

3. Source the Nav2 install for future terminal instances with `echo 'source /home/$USER/cda_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc`

4. A map and route graph will need to be created for physical test environments. The `turtlebot` configuration includes these for reference. Maps can be created using [slam_toolbox](https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox) and graphs should follow the examples given in this package. New maps and graphs will need to manually updated in the launch and parameter files.


## Launch

Run the following command to launch the CDA1tenth system:

```
$ ros2 launch cda1tenth_bringup cda1tenth_bringup_launch.xml vehicle:=[red_truck, blue_truck, turtlebot] record_bag:=[true, false]
```

This will launch all necessary subsystems, such as drivers, localization, and navigation.

### Launch Arguments
- `vehicle` controls the parameter file used to launch the system and requires an input

  - `red_truck` and `blue_truck` target parameter files specific to their respective CDA1tenth vehicles

  - `turtlebot` runs a Gazebo-based simulation that allows for running core `cda1tenth_bringup` packages locally without hardware interface nodes

- `record_bag` is a boolean argument for recording all data from the system in a ROS2 rosbag and defaults to `false`. Bags are saved in `~/cda_bags` along with a copy of the parameter file used


## Post launch

After launching the nodes included in `cda1tenth_bringup`, additional actions are needed to finalize the system on a physical vehicle.

1. Send an empty message to the `/ackermann_cmd` topic to initialize the VESC by publishing via command line on the vehicle with `ros2 pub /ackermann_cmd ackermann_msgs/msg/AckermannDriveStamped`. Use `CTRL + C` after a few have sent and the original terminal output has updated.

   > [NOTE]
   > The `vesc_to_odom_node` ROS node is responsible for publishing the odometry information it receives from the VESC motor controller. However, it does not start publishing this information until the VESC driver stack receives a command.

2. If using a physical vehicle, RViz will need to be launched on an external PC on the same network and `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` as the vehicle. A specific RViz configuration is needed for visualizing and interacting with Nav2, which can be found in this package under the `rviz` directory. Run RViz in a terminal using the command `rviz2` and open this file using `File > Open Config`.

3. In RViz, set the vehicle's initial pose estimate by selecting the `2D Pose Estimate` button at the top and drawing the approximate pose of the vehicle with respect to the map. The ROS2 nodes being used by the vehicle should be visualized after the estimate is drawn.

4. A navigation command can now be sent to the CDA1tenth vehicle by using the `2D Goal Pose` button to draw a goal pose on the map using the RViz GUI.

### Shutdown 
To shut down the system, use `CTRL + C` on the `cda1tenth_bringup` and `rviz2` terminals. Run `ros2 node list` to verify all nodes are shut down before relaunching the system.
